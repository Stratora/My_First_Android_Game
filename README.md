My_First_Android_Game is my first project for Android operation system. 

The game is a simple 2D game with effect of size changing (Characters which locate close to the top of screen are smaller than those which on the bottom)

### How to play.
You are controlling character which is in a jacket. 
Your character is controlled by two sticks. 
Left stick is for aiming and shooting. 
Right stick is for moving and boosting.
